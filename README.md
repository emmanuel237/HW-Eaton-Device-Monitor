# HW-Eaton-Device-Monitor
Eaton Interview Homework.

##Home work prompt : 
The problem to solve is following:

                You monitor devices, which are sending data to you.
               Each device has a unique name.
                Each device produces measurements. 

Challange is:

                Compute number of messages you got or read from the devices.

The solution can be in any language, preferably modern C++.
The scope is open, you must decide how the “devices” will work in your system.
The solution should be posted on GitHub or a similar page for a review.
Please add Makefile/CMakeLists and documentation explaining us how to run your code.
